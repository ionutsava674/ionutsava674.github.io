Guitar tabs found on the internet can be difficult for visually impaired individuals to read using screen readers. I wanted to help address this issue and make it easier for these musicians to access tabs. That's why I created 'Tab Extractor,' an iOS app that scans pages for guitar tabs, extracts the information, and stores it in a structured format for easy reading by screen readers.

Contrast-Enhancer is a windows application, written in C#. It is a tool with which you can take a snapshot of the current screen, and with easy mouse gestures, you can fine tune in real time several parameters of the image contrast.

* Contrast is amplified by diminishing the difference between the current light level, and the dynamic range limits.

* You can change the threshold from which contrast is amplified.

* You can fine tune the factor of amplification.
