        <h2>1. What is the purpose of this app?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">The app is designed to help rock climbers, especially those with visual impairments, improve their memory and spatial awareness by memorizing climbing routes. It provides a virtual environment where users can practice recalling sequences of moves, enhancing their cognitive skills for real-world climbing.</p>
