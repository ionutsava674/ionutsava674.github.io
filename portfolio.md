I am pleased to present my app portfolio, which showcases my experience and expertise in software development.
My name is Ionut Sava, and I am a 37-year-old software developer based in Romania.
I have been developing apps for several years, and my portfolio includes several applications, some of which are available on the AppStore. My apps are designed to solve real-world problems and deliver a great user experience. With my skills and experience, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your team.–

### [**1. Tab Extractor**](https://ionutsava674.github.io/Tab-Extractor/)

The first app I want to include is one very relevant for me. I didn’t want to write just another demo/sample tutorial app, but instead one that solves real life issues, and with real practicality.

Tab extractor is an IOS app that helps visually impaired guitar players gain access to the contents of guitar tabulatures. It is hard to convey how hard it is to access these using screen readers, but having the ability to easily swipe left and right, while learning a new song, makes a world of difference.

So what the app does is, load a website which the user enters; scans the inner- html content and detects the presence of any guitar tabs. Extracts the information from within, and presents the option to select and save them locally.
So it also acts as a personal library, of songs to learn.

Some mentionable techniques used within the app:
- using webKit to load websites, insert and execute javascript code block. • wrapping UIKit views and controllers in swiftUI view structs.
- running more consuming code in background threads.
- views, navigation stack and sheets.

Yes, not very original. Quite the opposite, probably the most popular card game ot there.

The reason for which i’ve decided to write this app is that, although Tab-Extractor is a real-world stand-on-its-own app, it is quite unsophisticated.

So a multi user interactive app, with reasonably complex states and logic, seemed a good way to go. One important aspect was learning gameKit api and integrating it with the swiftUI framework.

The game is available as macOS notarized app, since gambling content can no longer be submitted by privateindividuals on the AppStore.

- gameKit integration
- Task concurrency, async methods • push notifications
- Design patterns
- Multilanguage and localization

### [**3. Contrast Enhancer**](https://ionutsava674.github.io/ContrastEnhancer/)

<img src="icons/ce128x128.png" alt="Contrast Enhancer icon" style="width: 100px; float: left; margin: 15px;">
Initially I wrote this app just for personal use. Not very fancy but very helpful.

It is a windows app written in C#. What it does is allow you to take a screenshot and, using simple mouse gestures, you can fine tune the contrast and zoom of the image, depending on whatever needs to be enhanced. I wrote the first iteration of this app in Delphi for the Win32NT platform, but, the technology being outdated, I’ve refreshed it for the .NET platform, using C#.

### [**4. Intervals**](https://ionutsava674.github.io/intervals/)

<img src="icons/intervalsIcon.png" alt="Intervals icon" style="width: 100px; float: left; margin: 15px;">
Intervals is an interactive musical game, built for iOS, to test and train the ear to recognize musical scales. The app plays two different notes, and you have to guess the relative distance. An easy app, built around AVFoundation. Fun to built and fun to use.

## About me

### Bio and education

I’ve graduated the Automatics and Computer Science faculty within the Polytechnic University of Bucharest in 2011.

After graduating, because of my vision loss, I could no longer use and operate computers normally. So I had to do something, made a career switch, became a therapist and started practicing.
This stage is irrelevant for the purpose of the career I’m seeking, but i felt I had to mention this fact. So after years of getting more and more skilled with computers using accessibility tools, I’ve decided to turn to my true passion, and started coding.

While my personal experience with disability has given me a unique perspective, my apps are designed to be useful for anyone who needs them. I am passionate about making software that is inclusive and accessible to everyone.

Over the past two years, I have been focusing on iOS development using the SwiftUI framework. I have found this area of software development to be both challenging and rewarding, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

And I want to do so by showing some concrete projects that I’ve worked on and invested in.
