# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the software developer position at your company. 

My name is Ionut Sava, and I am a 37-year-old software developer based in Romania.

I have developed several apps, some of which are available on the app store, demonstrating my ability to deliver high-quality software solutions.

One of my areas of focus has been on creating apps that solve real-world problems for users. As a result, some of the apps that I have developed are geared towards people with disabilities. 

While my personal experience with disability has given me a unique perspective, my apps are designed to be useful for anyone who needs them. I am passionate about making software that is inclusive and accessible to everyone.

With a university degree in Computer Science and Automatics and several years of experience in software development, I have developed a diverse set of skills that I believe would make me an asset to your team.

Over the past two years, I have been focusing on iOS development using the SwiftUI framework. I have found this area of software development to be both challenging and rewarding, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

I am also drawn to your company because of its expertise in developing apps in the gambling and gaming domain. While one of the apps I have developed is a Texas Holdem game for Mac, I am interested in the technology behind all types of gaming apps. I understand the importance of creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface and am always looking for ways to improve the user experience.

My experience and education have equipped me with the necessary skills to develop high-quality software solutions. Additionally, my passion for creating user-friendly, inclusive software and my interest in the gaming domain would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Ionut Sava
